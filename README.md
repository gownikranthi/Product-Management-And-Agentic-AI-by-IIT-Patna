# Product Management and Agent AI by IIT Patna

## Overview

This repository serves as a structured portfolio and learning archive of my 6-month academic and hands-on journey through the **Product Management and Agentic AI program by IIT Patna**.  

The goal of this repository is twofold:
- To document my progression from **traditional product management fundamentals** to **modern AI-driven product leadership**
- To showcase applied work, frameworks, tools, and thinking patterns relevant to **Product Manager** and **AI Product Manager** roles

This repository is intentionally designed to be recruiter-friendly, evaluation-oriented, and reflective of real-world product problem-solving.

## Program Structure

The program is divided into **two semesters**, each spanning **three months**, with a strong emphasis on both theory and application.

### Semester 1: Foundations of Product Management

This semester focused on the **core principles of traditional product management**, building a strong conceptual and executional base.

Key areas of focus included:
- Product lifecycle management
- Market and user research
- User personas and problem discovery
- Writing PRDs and defining requirements
- Roadmapping and prioritization
- Stakeholder management
- Product metrics and success measurement
- Execution and delivery fundamentals

**Evaluation Structure (Semester 1):**
- Mid-term examination: 12%
- End-term examination: 13%
- Product project: 10%
- Mock exams and internal evaluations

### Semester 2: AI Product Management & Agentic Systems

The second semester emphasized **modern AI-first product management**, with a strong focus on **agentic systems, automation, and AI tooling**.

Key themes included:
- AI-first product thinking
- Designing products with LLMs and agents
- Prompt engineering for product workflows
- Automation-driven execution
- Agent workflows and orchestration
- Tool-assisted product discovery and delivery

**Evaluation Structure (Semester 2):**
- Mid-term examination
- End-term examination
- Applied AI/agentic project
- Final offline examination: 30% weightage

## What I Learned

### Traditional Product Management Skills

From the first semester, I developed a strong foundation in:
- Identifying and framing user problems
- Translating business goals into product requirements
- Writing clear and actionable PRDs
- Structuring product roadmaps aligned with strategy
- Collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders
- Measuring outcomes using product metrics
- Balancing trade-offs between scope, time, and impact

These skills reinforced disciplined, structured thinking required for scalable product execution.

### AI Product Management & Agentic Skills

The second semester expanded my skill set into **AI-native product leadership**, including:
- Designing products where AI is a core capability, not an add-on
- Understanding agent-based architectures and workflows
- Using AI tools to accelerate research, ideation, and execution
- Creating automation pipelines for repetitive product tasks
- Applying prompt engineering to improve system reliability and outcomes
- Evaluating AI systems from usability, ethics, and scalability perspectives

This phase reshaped how I think about **speed, leverage, and experimentation** in product management.

## Evaluation & Academic Rigor

This program follows a structured academic evaluation model, combining:
- Timed examinations
- Applied product projects
- Mock assessments
- Offline final evaluation

The repository reflects not just outcomes, but also **process, reasoning, and learning depth**, aligned with academic rigor and industry relevance.

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to ensure clarity and ease of navigation:

- `/Semester-1-Foundations/` – Traditional product management concepts and work
- `/Semester-2-Agentic-AI/` – AI product management and agentic systems
- `/Projects/` – Applied product and AI projects
- `/Notes/` – Theory notes, frameworks, and insights
- `/Exams-and-Evaluations/` – Preparation materials and reflections

This structure mirrors how a product manager organizes thinking: from strategy to execution.

---

## Closing Note

This repository represents my growth from understanding **how products are built** to learning **how AI-powered products should be designed, evaluated, and scaled**.  

It reflects a transition toward an **AI Product Manager mindset**—one that is outcome-driven, user-focused, and deeply aware of how emerging technologies reshape product strategy and execution.
